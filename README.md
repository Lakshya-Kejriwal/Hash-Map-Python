# Hash-Map-Python

This is an implementation of a primitive hashmap in python with operations such as 

1. `set(key, value)` : This stores the value in the hashmap with key by generation an index according to the key.
2. `get(key)` : This returns the value associated with the key.
3. `delete(key)` : Deletes the value associated with the key
4. `load()`: Returns the load factor of the hash map given by (items in hashmap / total size of hashmap)
